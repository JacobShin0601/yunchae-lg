      "Nickel is a crucial component in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, prized for increasing the range of EVs. Indonesia has become the world's largest nickel producer, with about half of the global nickel currently mined there. By 2027, analysts predict that approximately 80% of the global nickel supply used in EV batteries will come from Indonesia. The country's nickel is attractive to car makers because it's found close to the surface, making extraction relatively cheap compared to deep underground mining in countries like Canada and Russia. However, the extraction process in Indonesia, often using high-pressure acid leaching, is about twice as carbon-intensive as methods used elsewhere. This process leaves behind large amounts of waste and poses environmental risks, particularly to pristine ecosystems and coral reefs surrounding the mining areas. Despite these concerns, Indonesia's government sees nickel as a way to move up the value chain in the global EV battery supply chain, restricting nickel exports to encourage in-country processing and potentially battery and car manufacturing.\n",

      " our commodity race continues I hope you're entertained guys I made eight videos about uranium I brought the biggest uranium buyer in the world here to the office and you heard what he said now uranium broke out is up by a lot and it followed this trend line exactly and to those who say that Commodities are boring because price movements are small remember that unlike altcoins Commodities you can definitely trade successfully with leverage there are wheat Futures with 500x leverage and there are commodity companies that can go 100x thousand X so boring it's just not the correct term congrats to everyone who paid attention and maybe took our course with the commodity scope now with cryptos dwelling and chopping in the wake of regulatory attacks from the SEC in the US I hope you see the power of true diversification and today we continue a few weeks ago I covered oil and gas today it's an episode I'm really looking forward to myself battery Metals given the volume of information we will be keeping this session focused but please realize that it will be dense and it will be lengthy so grab your coffee and let's go first we will talk about the general energy thesis then we will outline how a typical EV battery is made up and how battery Metals fit in to this thesis and finally we will outline for each of the various battery methods what the demand and Supply characteristics are what jurisdictional issues and risks there are where to focus and some of the key players in the market I would love your input and feedback please comment below first let's look at the access we have to energy and energy consumption varies a lot across the world we are all used to using dishwashers laundry machines dryers TVs radios fridges computers electric cores you name it all the electronics we use and the massive increase in electronics we have seen over the past 20 years result in a significant electricity usage for those of us who can afford it the average consumption and has increased by approximately 45 percent moreover we've seen a tremendous growth in developing countries and China's per capita use has grown 250 percent since year 2000. India's usage has grown 50 percent and Brazil's usage has grown 38 however compared to the usage in the western economy there is still a long way to go a typical American uses 10 times the average Indian five times the average Brazilian and three times the average Chinese citizen so clearly the trend of energy usage growth will continue essentially we have 8 billion people on Earth and two of those have access to intermittent energy and one billion has no access to energy at all for the 5 billion who have access to energy all of them want the same energy usage as the west and nobody is going to stop them if you look at how much is being invested in clean energy we see it's a lot it's like a trillion then if you look at the impact that has had on the overall and energy consumption renewable energy consumption present to Total final energy consumption while we can see that this is growing even though this is a few years old if you look at actual numbers here on the side we see that it's not growing on that fast pace if spent per year is 1 trillion you probably need to spend another like 5 trillion for each percentage Point gain here also as we covered in previous videos oil and gas is also going up uranium is going up yearly and coal having its highest consumption in 2022 ever with 8.3 billion tons this all makes sense all developing countries are looking to develop further and that requires energy they want to live like you and I and because of that in the foreseeable future we will see an ongoing use of fossil fuels coal and so on probably 2023 will hit another peak in Coal usage but of course that also means that there is a very fast growing Market focused on energy transition green energy renewable energy and that means that there will be a lot lot more focus on supply distribution and storage of energy all of this is good I believe that more energy sources is positive for our development as a species and as you know I think uranium fits in that world with the logarithm focus on Greener energies so going forward in this video we will focus both on battery and electric Metals by which methods are we talking about in that case here's a good article outlining the different methods we have the batteries going downwards here and we have the use cases along the horizontal axis and these are all materials that are critical for the transition to a low carbon economy and as you see electric vehicles use many of these methods not only lithium which is maybe the method we will think about first but there is manganese graphite Cobalt turbium silicon pressio damium neodymium disoprocium nickel aluminum copper and steel and then we have all the other use cases let's say simplify this a bit to the critical methods required for the energy transition which covers energy storage energy generation and energy transport which according to sprout ETFs that we all know or uranium addressed in many videos from before lithium copper nickel silver also addressed separately manganese Cobalt graphite Vanadium and for a quick overview of rare Earths in essence where Earths are not rare they just occur in low concentrations in the Earth's crust compared to other metals which makes it difficult to acquire them through mining they also corrode relatively quickly which creates other problems rare Earths are used in magnets used in EVS they provide the strongest permanent magnets but in addition to that also for many other industrial uses like sensors Electronics traction Motors and trains rare Earths or small portal damage transition we will not focus on them before we go into each of the methods let us go over what is the makeup of an electric vehicle EV battery and while this is by no means an exhaustive overview it's important to understand the workings of an EV battery first I think electric cars use lithium ion batteries since they are high capacity and can recharge fully with minimal energy loss here we have the main components with the cost breakdown for the cathode manufacturing anode separator electrolyte and housing the anode is the passive side of the battery cell typically made of graphite the cat toad or sorry that's the Swedish pronunciation cathode is the active part of the battery itself a typical EV battery like nmc 532 5 nickel three manganese two Cobalt would contain an 8 kilo lithium carbonate 35 kilo nickel 20 kilo manganese is and 14 kilo of cobalt there are a wide range of lithium batteries on the market that combine different methods and lithium such as manganese or iron but at their core they areolithium batteries and like an NCM 622 battery would be 6 nickel to Cobalt and two manganese as highlighted on this document there are significant costs involved but they have been declining since 2010. most battery cells are manufactured in China about 80 percent and we will get back to that shortly however what is important to note is that depending on the type of application different chemicals and different ratios are used for batteries for example sodium batteries are not a threat to lithium batteries because they are grid scale batteries they are larger note tense and they are not for that reason suitable for transport now let's look at the value chain it starts with raw materials and we will add line key component for each of the various Commodities from there we move into building the various cell components the finished product is then distributed to end users like EVs and finally we see recycling taking place at the end of the battery's Life as a final note the value obtained from the mining stage is very low in general about one percent most value comes from the processing cell production and Battery assembly lithium first there is more than sufficient lithium globally with a total reserves of about 26 million tons the main producers are Australia 6.2 million until 9.3 million China is actually only a third with about 3 million tons in reserves there are essentially two different types of lithium Source brine which comes from Chile and spodomin I think it's pronounced or hard rock which comes from Australia scaling or mining of spodomin is relatively easy to do through a process of crushing roasting and acid leaching while scaling of the Chilean brine is difficult due to the large evaporation plans required you basically evaporate it and then recover it chemically it's complex and it takes time Chile and Mexico and other lithium producers or naturalizing lithium companies and this will have likely a negative impact on the production over the coming years in case they continue this path in Australia the challenge of scaling is around the processing of the spodomy and the processing of lithium globally has two or three main players China with about 60 of the processing capability globally and Chile 27 Argentina which now stands at around eight percent will grow significantly in the coming years Australia on the other hand has only three percent of the global processing capacity so it's pretty clear where the bottleneck is in terms of end markets eighty percent of lithium production ends up in batteries only about six percent is used for glass and Ceramics and other use cases so lithium is definitely really positioned to benefit from the battery Revolution it's not only hype in terms of supply and demand operational Supply is more or less flat from 2025. the secondary Supply is reasonable to assume through recycling although we have to note that batteries will last an average five years currently about 45 percent of all batteries are being recycled recycle lithium batteries do not have the mhg that new lithium have which make them unsuitable for energy storage this only covers the blue bars so in essence leaves a huge gap between the production including Recycling and the demand for both the base case and the upside EV demand case so in other words over the next few years 2024 2025 2026 we will see a gap emerge between supply and demand where the bifurcation between the west and the East with China currently owning 60 of the processing capacity will result in the west having to invest heavily to build out processing capacity to keep production is concentrated in the hands of a few key manufacturers Albemarle sqm live vent Corporation or Cobra gun thing lithium coat janki lithium mainly located in America's Asia and Australia then in terms of processing supply chain there are essentially two ways to produce lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide either from lithium brine or from sportamine both of these contain quite many steps before you get lithium carbonate out the other end while there is no shortage of lithium the lack of processing capacity and quickly bifurcating Market means that the West needs to urgently focus on securing processing capacity China owns 60 percent and Chile and Mexico on nationalizing their lithium so for that reason it's very possible that for the near future lithium prices will continue their downward strand because Western companies are still building out their processing capabilities as you see in 2021 we had this huge run up but this year we've had an almost 40 percent drop right now sitting at minus 34 from the peak another good example on why parabolas can be useful by the way if we now move on to Copper corporis key friendly transition as well as many other Industries like the fans like Telecom and like the medical field for example copper is produced in various countries globally Chile being the home to the world's largest mines is condida and Kola huasi Chile is producing 27 of global Copper at 5.6 million tons there are various other countries like Peru China and DRC which are also top producers in Copper China is the biggest copper ore processing country with approximately 40 percent of the global capacity till last 10 percent Japan six percent DRC 5 and the U.S 4 four percent or the next in line copper processing is also complicated that begins with mining The Ore which has less than one percent copper content and ends with sheets of 99.99 pure copper called cathodes which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use in terms of earned markets building construction is the by far biggest with 30 followed by electronics and electronic products 12 Transportation 11 industrial Machinery 15 consumer and general products 12 and EVS are actually only three percent of the market currently so they don't impact the supply and demand Dynamics much however this percentage is expected to grow with a kegger of approximately 22 percent of the next eight years until 2030. if you now look at the supply and demand in 2031 there will be a supply Gap according to this analysis but until about 2026 supply and demand are bad balanced as far as these researchers can assess so for the foreseeable future there is no immediate shortage there is much less processing capacity in the west compared to the east so this is perhaps where we need to focus China accounts for 52 percent of the global consumption Asia another 15 so that leaves the U.S with only eight percent and Europe at 16 with like just a quarter of the consumption practically in line with our production the use of copper for wind and solar even though it's a small percentage of the global corporate demand is expected to double between now and 2030. investments in copper mines has been limited under invested so with a massive growth in demand not only from Battery perspective big upswing in prices over the next few years is at least possible despite what I said earlier here are some key companies Vale glencore BHP Freeport macmoran kodalco ZN mining group first Quantum minerals angular American in terms of the processing supply chain there are two types of copper ore copper oxide corpuscle feet and they undergo two different processes Hydro Metallurgy and pyrometology both resulting in the same final product you can read more about it here it's pretty interesting coprock seed is more prevalent near the surface while the Copperas will feed is of higher quality but deeper into the crust I did know this once in my life but only in Swedish so apologies for the poor pronunciation so like with lithium there is sufficient copper in the world in the near future if we have a significant economic downturn especially one which impacts China remember that building construction is the number one copper usage we could see a reduction in the corporate demand actually however in the 2030s it's likely that there will be pressure to further explore and mine for Corporal with under Investments on the supply side while the near-term price action might be bearish low long term is probably bullish for copper if we look at the Copper Futures we see this balance that I've talked about clearly reflected in the chart we have a range bottom here and the range to appear and within the range we basically just have chop because it could be possible to try to trade this between the range extremes but generally that's not my strength okay when preparing for this video we have actually prepared the material also for nickel manganese Cobalt graphite and Vanadium one audio but I realize now that I'm recording it that this is way too much for this video people not gonna watch is too much information in one video so let's stop here at the first two you guys give feedback if this is what you're looking for if this is interesting depending on how that turns out we'll give you another five before we conclude on which Commodities we are focusing on before we conclude remember if you take the course you get the Commodities scope included then use this link here on the Commodities and for all of you who joined Pro congratulations because there will be additional benefits for everyone on the pro tier if you haven't joined Pro you go to CTO larson.com and click Pro here at the top so which one of these Commodities are really focused on if you can pick only one from the list I mean apart from uranium if you focus specifically on the battery methods I think it's too early to conclude that before we go on over the other five but do not undress the mate copper it's kind of underlooked here there's very broad application is part of the infrastructure there is no technological risks but for the reasons outlined we're probably more interested in the processing companies both for lithium and for copper and that conclusion I haven't seen discussed as much even though it's pretty apparent when we're looking at the data like this isn't it we will keep close tabs on all the seven Commodities mentioned in this video and provide regular updates Please Subscribe and like thank you Tech CTO Larson out hello\n"
