Neither operations have been proven on a 'large scale'. 30 years ago America had like 90% of the supply of lithium. Within the past few years, US's share of the pie had dropped to a whopping 2%. Why? What does Australia and Chile have in common? Australia produces over 50% of the global supply of lithium, which is done purely by hard rock spoduemene. In Chile, (or the lithium triangle there) supply a good portion of say 40%, which is done purely by extracting lithium from the brine salars through evaporation. \n\nIf America is going to have a lithium market of it's own, raw material has to be imported and refined. But it's a dirty process and the environmentalists have this NIMBY problem. Which is why China owns the supply chain and refining. \n\nBiden just passed a 100% tax on Chinese EV imports into America.

Lithium demand will obviously grow, however other battery technologies could take market share away from Lithium, along with the growth of ubiquitous EV super charging technologies, so that range becomes less significant and vehicles can operate more efficiently, without having to carry a huge battery around as extra luggage. Thus Lithium battery sizes could actually fall in a mature ubiquitous EV supercharging market. If you have an EV super charger say every 10 miles in a matured EV market, then you don't need Lithium batteries. You can use cheaper less energy dense battery technologies, like sodium. In such an environment, a 250 km range would be way more than adequate for the majority of use cases.",

Well that's only 35 to 40% by 2030....\n\nIt is coming and there's no stopping it. \n\nWhether that lithium comes from domestic sources or not is questionable..... At current prices those sources aren't viable.     Mining is all about concentration\n\nBattery cost is irrelevant.  $1,000 on the cost of a $50,000 car is a round off error.... That's just how manufacturers blame lack of anybody wanting to buy their cars\n\nWhen we have charging infrastructure and better batteries it will take off rapidly.... The batteries are just around the corner but unfortunately nobody's building the charging infrastructure\n\nLow margin lithium producers are going to struggle and squeak by..... With their dilute sources.... And concentrated producers... Will make ob scene amounts of money\n\nThe holy grail  of  batteries will be solid-state lithium sulfide.  They have incredible storage capacity.. up to 2600 W-h/kg........8x The capacity of production batteries today.    \n\nThey're simply working on solving the dendrite issues currently",

I thought it was well sealed, however it wasn't and water got in and it must have seeped through the terminals or a joint somewhere. It did take a year to fail though. When it was pulled apart it had lots of individual cells that looked like D size batteries all spot welded with strips of metal in a series parallel arrangement. Anyway the cells all tested evenly, so it all got some WD40 and a brush clean, then a new BMS and it's been running fine INSIDE my tool box for another 3 or 4 years since. Mine get strapped down with lots of foam under them just to keep vibrations down as well. Thanks for pulling it apart to let us see what's inside. And always wear gloves/glasses/PPE when dealing with this sort of stuff, you only get one set of lungs and 2 eyes and they don't grow back.",

Also, the battery probably is “water resistant” as they claim, but of note water resistant is a measure of how much water ingress you can get depending on water pressures applied to the object. If you hit this with high pressure water, e.g. in an under body car wash, or hitting a water crossing at speed, then the water pressure will exceed the water resistance of the packaging. But again, great video, informative and fun to watch!",

That's an improvement of  60.4% with  no pugging in, zero pain and zero inconvenience.  If every car sold saved 60% on fuel use, it would equal much more fuel saved overall than 1 in 10 cars being electric.  I see hybrids and plug in hybrids as the smartest way to go.  If  the sale of new ICE vehicles are outlawed, a lot of people will be out of the new car market and will be buying used for many years to come.   Then watch used ICE car prices spike again!",

As much as I vastly prefer the EV’s, I can’t see a day in the near future when I would want to limit myself to one fuel choice.  Eventually, that may change but IMO, letting BEV’s become the majority option should happen organically and at the will of the consumer.

Even gas stations in the Patagonia can be few and far between on both the Argentina (if they have gas) and Chilean side. Yea, so it is going to be a while before that is an option for me. Now in theory, a hybrid could do the job. I am holding off on buying one, because they are significantly more expensive than a gas vehicle. I did however give a Toyota hybrid some serious consideration. I just prefer vehicles with easily sourced local parts and service. I have three Toyotas in my yard, that all have more less compatible parts. My mechanic and I knows how to work on all of them. An EV breaks down, I am shipping it on a (diesel) flatbed, thousand+ kilometers to get fixed, and shipped back. The parts, are all on the other side of the World. It would be weeks or months before I could drive my car again. So, I will let everyone else fully work all the bugs out of the EV system first; and, it is a system (suply chain, energy infrastructure, service, parts, regulations, etc).",

That’s what has kept me from buying one to be honest. \n\nI’d like to see a return to making cars and propulsion technology a bit simpler. That will make new cars less expensive and therefore more accessible, and the net gain in getting many older more polluting vehicles off the road is also a win. They would also weigh less, be cheaper to maintain and more reliable. I think we’re going to pay the price for the complexity necessary to eke out the very last bit of efficiency from ICE drivetrains and surrounding them in an overweight, technology-laden package. Sadly, I think that ship has sailed though.",

If youve seen the strip mines in places like Africa and parts of South America, we are literally cutting down forests and/ir destroying ecosystems to use patroleum-fueler machina to dig hundreds of feet to find the rare metals needed to construct these batteries, the manufacturing process is very energy intensive. On top of that currently there is no way to fully or even partially recycle modern EV batteries. Also, instead of buying a gas or even a hybrid car that can be driven for 10-20 years and 100s of thousands of miles, means we're not using energy to make so many new vehicles. An EV battery is good for MAYBE 150k mi, then youre stuck with a giant heavy piece of useless hazardous waste that cant be cleanly or completely recycled and have to pay thousands for a new battery that will only last you another 100k mi. Then of course the grid in most places is powered primarily by coal or natural gas, and our demand for electricity will undoubtedly increase as more and more EVs are charging on the grid. It would be a lot better if they could be charged during the day when solar energy can be the primary source or power (in CA during the day up to 80% of the grid's electricity is being generatee by solar) but thats wheb people are USING their cars so they charge them at night when less renewable energy is available when fossil fuels are powering the grid. These are all points that are never mentioned and considered, and they need to be if our governments are going to FORCE us to buy EVs exclusively in the future.",

His reasoning was u need 2 engines to use petrol and electricity respectively, small battery capacity and inefficiency due to the excess weight of both system and I think weaker engines again due to having 2 system. It certainly makes common sense and his vids didn’t suggest a ev agenda. \n\nI understand there are erev where u can use petrol to directly power the electric engine.

These mills often had their own hydroelectric dams and access to international waterways, so there's a lot of potential there for repurposing. It's about time government agencies start paying attention and look into ways to breathe new life into these assets for the sake of the local communities and the economy.",

Likewise, CTR (an Australian firm) is in California's 'Salton Sea' for the past decade, again, embarking on another major science experiment of trying to extract lithium using DLE from salt brines. Neither operations have been proven on a 'large scale'. 30 years ago America had like 90% of the supply of lithium. Within the past few years, US's share of the pie had dropped to a whopping 2%. Why? What does Australia and Chile have in common? Australia produces over 50% of the global supply of lithium, which is done purely by hard rock spoduemene. In Chile, (or the lithium triangle there) supply a good portion of say 40%, which is done purely by extracting lithium from the brine salars through evaporation. \n\nIf America is going to have a lithium market of it's own, raw material has to be imported and refined. But it's a dirty process and the environmentalists have this NIMBY problem. Which is why China owns the supply chain and refining. \n\nBiden just passed a 100% tax on Chinese EV imports into America. While places like NZ (who have free trade with China), and Australia, have opened the door on Chinese brand EVs.",

Lithium demand will obviously grow, however other battery technologies could take market share away from Lithium, along with the growth of ubiquitous EV super charging technologies, so that range becomes less significant and vehicles can operate more efficiently, without having to carry a huge battery around as extra luggage. Thus Lithium battery sizes could actually fall in a mature ubiquitous EV supercharging market. If you have an EV super charger say every 10 miles in a matured EV market, then you don't need Lithium batteries. You can use cheaper less energy dense battery technologies, like sodium. In such an environment, a 250 km range would be way more than adequate for the majority of use cases.",

Wer weiß was noch passiert?\n- Was wird mit dem Verkaufserlös passieren? Bleibt das Management OnBoard und versucht ein neues Projekt hochzuziehen? Im aktuellen Lithium Markt würde das Geld reichen um eine größere Übernahme zu machen.\n\nMein Bauchgefühl: ich denke, das LLL Team hatte gar keine andere Wahl als das Projekt zu verkaufen, da das Government sich komplett quer gestellt hat. Unter diesen Umständen ist der Deal nicht all zu schlecht. Mali als Land wird sich damit aber in Zukunft wohl jegliche Chance auf westliches Kapital vertan haben. Es ist ja nicht nur die Einigung mit LLL an sich, das Mali Government hat sich ohne rechtliche Grundlage durch den \"neuen\" Mining Code viel mehr % am Projekt gesichert als Ihnen zusteht. \n\nAlles noch sehr früh - also abwarten & positiv bleiben 🙂",
